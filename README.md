Victor's Master Thesis
======================

This repo is meant exclusively for personal organization. Everything you may find
here may be very far away from usable, although I plan to keep an up-to-date
description of what's going on here.

Repo Structure
==============

Inside the directory `Agda/Rel` you will find the Relational Algebra Library we are
currently developing. The other folders inside `Agda/` are experimental/old/nonsense code.

Into `Thesis` you should find everything that is needed to compile my report.

The rewrite library is hosted at a [separate repository](https://github.com/VictorCMiraldo/agda-rw)
