This chapter is concerned with background concepts. The idea is to keep this dissertation as
mathematically self contained as possible, although for a full understanding of this kind of topics, further
reading is necessary. Some very important basic ideas are introduced below that provide the underlying foundations of proof assistants such as Agda.

As already mentioned in section \ref{sec:prelude:agdalanguage}, Agda is both a programming language and a proof assistant. The programming side of Agda is a pure functional language and is built on top of the (dependently typed) $\lambda$-calculus. Such a formalism will be briefly presented in section \ref{sec:background:lambdacalculus}. The proof assistant view, on the other hand, lies on top of the Curry-Howard isomorphism, which will be presented in section \ref{sec:background:curryhoward}. Yet, Agda seems to be
more general than the Curry-Howard isomorphism since it can handle first order logic out of the box. 
This generalization is explained in \ref{sec:background:martinlof}, where a surface description
of Martin L\"{o}f's theory of types is given.

The reader familiar with these topics can safely skip this chapter.
