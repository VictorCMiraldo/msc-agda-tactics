In this chapter we'll introduce some background notions. The ideia is to keep this thesis
mathematically self contained, but for a full understanding of this kind of topics, further
reading is necessary. The reader familiar with $\lambda$-calculus and the Curry-Howard isomorphism for simply typed terms can skip this chapter.

As we already mentioned in section \ref{sec:prelude:agdalanguage} Agda is both a programming language and a proof assistant. The programming side of Agda is a pure functional languague and is built on top of the (dependently typed) $\lambda$-calculus, such formalism will be briefly presented in section \ref{sec:background:lambdacalculus}. The proof assistant view, on the other hand, lies on top of the Curry-Howard isomorphism. We'll introduce this topic in section \ref{sec:background:curryhoward}.
