The current developments within Relational Algebra in Agda vary a lot, mainly due to
different goals. One has a plethora of options when developing a library. It is therefore
important to weight options against goals. As far as we know, at the time
of writing, there is no library that fit our specific goals, which
are: (a) An expressive encoding of relational algebra; (b) easy to handle at the meta-level,
for automatic rewriting.

The library built by Kahl, \cite{RATHAgda}, is not specific to Relational Algebra.
Instead, Kahl chose to build a library for Category Theory in general, from which one can use
the specific category of relations, \catname{Rel}. The theories in RATH-Agda are intended
for high-level programming, not so much focused on theorem proving. Thus
the equality problem we ran into is not handled in Kahl's library. RATH-Agda has both an equality up to
isomorphism and intensional equality, which are not interchangeable. Later on, the library
defines the relational operations on top of the categorical basis, also provided by the library.
Relational Equality is defined by mutual inclusion and, since no rewriting is intended,
substitutivity of relational equality is not provided. Another problem we would run into
had we used RATH-Agda is the quoted representation of terms. In Kahl's library every
construction is defined as a top-level function, therefore it is expanded upon quoting. 

Another interesting library is the one developed by Jansson, Mu and Ko at \cite{Jansson09}. 
Their goal, however, is again very different from both RATH-Agda and this project.
Mu, et al., are focusing on deriving programs given specifications, which is a big merit of
functional programming. Indeed, they explore the equational reasoning of programs in order to keep
\emph{refining} programs. They also avoid the non-extensional equality problem by defining
another equality type and proving its substitutiveness whenever necessary. Their main focus
is on subrelation-reasoning, though.
