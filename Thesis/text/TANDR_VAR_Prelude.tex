Chapter \ref{chap:termsandrewritting} discussed the construction of a tactic that handles \emph{one}
goal, given \emph{one} action. What if we tried to generalize this?
The best case scenario would be the handling a number of goals and actions at the same time, 
maintaining a linear time complexity. That is a very hard achievement! 
Such tool would be a completely automatic theorem prover. By compiling all theorems and 
lemmas of a given theory in Agda and ask for proofs, such ideal tool would return the proof 
objects regardless of the theorem to be proved.

It is plausible, however, to try to handle either \emph{multiple} goals, with given actions or to find
the correct action, given \emph{multiple} actions, to solve \emph{one} goal. These possible
extensions to the library are the object of discussion of this chapter. Sections \ref{sec:tandr:transitivity}
and \ref{sec:tandr:trie} explore those options, respectively.
