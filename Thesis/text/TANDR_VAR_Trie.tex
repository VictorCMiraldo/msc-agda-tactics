The handling of multiple actions for the same goal would bring us closer to what
\emph{auto} or \emph{tauto} do in Coq. We could have whole theories compiled in some sort
of database and let our tool figure out which of those lemmas to apply. Since the goal is
fixed, there should be one solution. A naive extension to our library could be made:

\Agda{RW}{by+-def}

However, a \F{List} of names is a bad data structure to use here. We need to search
every single action, where, we could rule out actions purely based on their structure.
Indeed, we are going to explore an alternative data structure to speed up search and get
instantiation for free, during lookup.

  \item cite Tries, Edward Fredkin
\end{TODO}

This section starts with a summarized explanation of Tries and then follows with our
generalization of the same concept. The structure we arrive at is a type-indexed data structure,
in the sense of \cite{Hinze04}. Yet, our lookup and insertion methods have to be significantly different
since we have to handle variables, that can be arbitralily instantiated.
